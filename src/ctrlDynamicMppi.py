# given state of the vehicle and an instance of track, provide throttle and steering output
# input:
#   state: (x,y,heading,v_forward,v_sideway,omega)
#   track: track object, can be RCPtrack or skidpad
#   v_override: If specified, use this as target velocity instead of the optimal value provided by track object
#   reverse: true if running in opposite direction of raceline init direction

# output:
#   (throttle,steering,valid,debug) 
# ranges for output:
#   throttle -1.0,self.max_throttle
#   steering as an angle in radians, TRIMMED to self.max_steering, left(+), right(-)
#   valid: bool, if the car can be controlled here, if this is false, then throttle will also be set to 0
#           This typically happens when vehicle is off track, and track object cannot find a reasonable local raceline
# debug: a dictionary of objects to be debugged, e.g. {offset, error in v}
    # NOTE this is the Stanley method, now that we have multiple control methods we may want to change its name later
